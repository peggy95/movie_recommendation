# movie_recommendation
-- course final project

This project is a final project which aimed at practicing data processing skills and learning shllow learning.
So this is not a classical recommendation engine which uses MF, GBDT+LR etc.. We recommend movies for movies in consideration of movie context. Uses' information is rarely used.
The most intersting part here are to reduce the number of keywords using ntlk and to analysis the actors and directors' social network. 

For now, I'd better to use more advanced methods to solve this problem such as Collaborative Filtering and deep networks (deep and wide) to recommend movies to users based on users' historical behaviours.
